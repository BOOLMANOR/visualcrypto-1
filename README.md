Visual cryptography
==============

**Input**: 3 images of equal size

**Output**: The same images in black-and-white mode with additional noise and the property that the third image equals to the first and second overlaid.

To overlay images by hand, you can drag the combined image on itself using Opera browser up to 12.17 version, or any modern web browser with proper ghost image script.
